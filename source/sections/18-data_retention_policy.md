# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Upward Health understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Upward Health is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Upward Health has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Upward Health Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

## 18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Upward Health Customers have data stored by Upward Health as a part of the Upward Health Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Upward Health and/or to have Upward Health continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Upward Health will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Upward Health within 30 days, Upward Health removes data from Upward Health systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
